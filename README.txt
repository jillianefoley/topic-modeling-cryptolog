The PDFs here were downloaded on September 25, 2015 from the NSA website where they were originally posted: https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/declass/cryptologs.shtml. Each file was hosted at https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/cryptologs/<FILENAME>

The OCRed text files were downloaded on October 31, 2015 from http://cryptome.org/2013/03/cryptologs/00-cryptolog-index.htm (specifically http://cryptome.org/2013/03/nsa-cryptologs-txt.zip). Their text conversion seems to be better than the free one (xpdf pdftotext) that I tried, which smoothed columns together.
